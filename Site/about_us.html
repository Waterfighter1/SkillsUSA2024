			<h1>About Us</h1>
        <img src="assets/building.jpg" alt="Pet Shelter Logo" class="align-self-center"/>
              <p class="mt-4">
                The Mt. Pleasant Animal Shelter is a city operated facility with one
                full time director, 1 full time animal control officer, one part time
                animal control officer and many dedicated volunteers. We take in stray,
                abandoned, injured, and homeless dogs that are within the city limits of
                Mt. Pleasant. We are unable to take in cats unless they are injured or
                un able to care for them selves, such as un-weaned, and motherless
                kittens. Unfortunately, there is no state law or city ordinance against
                cats running at large at this time. Our animal control officers are
                responsible for responding to calls for service relating to dogs at
                large, dog bites, and animal cruelty. Pet owners, please don’t let your
                dogs roam at large at any time and keep a collar with a current rabies
                tag on them at all times. Provide your pet with access to food, water,
                adequate shelter, and vet care, if needed, at all times. This is a state
                law and a city ordinance. We will issue citations for these violations
                starting at $193.00. Please be a responsible pet owner. Dogs and cats
                already spayed or neutered at the time of adoption will have an adoption
                fee of $75 and can go home the same day. Dogs and cats that are not
                spayed or neutered at the time of adoption will have an adoption fee of
                $25 . Those animals will then be made a spay or neuter appointment at
                one of our local vets. We will take them to your choice of local vet and
                you will be responsible for picking up your new pet and paying for their
                spay or neuter fee to the vet.
              </p>
